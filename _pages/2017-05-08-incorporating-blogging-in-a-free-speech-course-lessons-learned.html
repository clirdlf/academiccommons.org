<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details</p>
<p>Instructor Name:</p>
<p>David A. Reichard</p>
<p>Course Title:</p>
<p>Free Speech and Responsibility</p>
<p>Institution:</p>
<p>California State University Monterey Bay</p>
<p>What is the overall aim of the course?:</p>
<p>This course serves meets the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://hcom.csumb.edu/site/x4169.xml">Relational Communication</a> outcome required for all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://hcom.csumb.edu/site/x2248.xml">Human Communication</a> majors (an integrated humanities degree). It also fulfills concentrations in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://hcom.csumb.edu/site/x4037.xml">Pre-Law</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://hcom.csumb.edu/site/x4038.xml">Practical &amp; Professional Ethics</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://hcom.csumb.edu/site/x4039.xml">Journalism</a>. The goal is for students to contend with ethical and effective ways to communicate through intensive study of free speech.</p>
<p>Course design and scope of the project:</p>
<p>Forty students take this semester-long course, meeting in four separate seminars. This allows them to work closely with the same group on a consistent basis. After seminar, the class reconvenes as a larger group, drawing connections among the discussions, and mapping our observations and questions on the board.</p>
<p>Incorporation of Technology:</p>
<p>At first, each seminar had its own weblog, or blog, using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">Moveable Type</a> and hosted on a server. I was administrator of all blogs, students were authors. The next time I offered the course, students created individual blogs using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://www.blog-city.com/bc/">Blog-City</a>, a free commercial blogging host. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620212708/http://dar.blog-city.com/">blogged</a> too.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned:</p>
<p>Blogging should connect with course content and students should see that connection; otherwise it seems like busy work. Second, the more creative freedom students had, the more they embraced blogging. With less faculty "control," student blogs became individualized, perfect for free speech, but perhaps not for other kinds of curricula.</p>

<p>Measured Results:</p>
<p>Blogs were important spaces for students to record notes, pose questions, and organize their ideas before and after seminar.  However, some students found blogging repetitive or a poor substitute for face-to-face interactions. These findings became clear from observation of seminars, reading student blogs, and reviewing mid-term and final assessments (which specifically addressed blogging). Most importantly, students wrote essays analyzing their own and other students' blogs. These essays provided invaluable "meta" analysis of student learning in the course. Significantly, students described blogs as providing a public record of their own learning, making their process as learners visible to themselves and others.</p>
