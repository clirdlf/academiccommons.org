<p class="NMC-Normal">Created to accompany the eponymous textbook (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100716212115/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0073014656/103-9917747-4784636?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance"><u>The Physical Universe</u></a>, by Konrad B. Krauskopf and Arthur Beiser; McGraw-Hill), this extensive site includes animations and figures for each chapter, along with study questions and exercises.Â  The site stands on its own with introductory text for each topic that sets the stage for exploration within subject areas such as the scientific method, matter and energy, the atom, the Periodic Law, and the solar system, among others.</p>
<p class="NMC-Normal">Some animations and figures include audio descriptions (text transcripts are also provided). Although the site is linked closely to the book, it could be used as a resource to learn more about a particular topic even without the book. Goals for learning and follow-up questions help guide the learner, and key concepts are outlined with important terms linked to the glossary.</p>
