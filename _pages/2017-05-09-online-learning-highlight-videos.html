<p>Two short videos prepared by the Online Learning department at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) showcase the center's activities. The first video, "Online Learning Showcase" (6 minutes long), is an overview of several projects at RIT. Topics include Pachyderm, the Student Response System, RIT's course management systems approach, remote tutoring with Breeze Meeting and blended learning courses.The second video, "A Conversation on Blended Learning" (5 minutes long), highlights the advantages of using technology to facilitate teamwork and social networking among deaf and hearing students—in this case, activities that were previously only possible with the assistance of an interpreter. The video tells the story of how technology not only allows for the interactions to happen, but enables a deaf student to take on a leadership role in the class—without an interpreter.</p>
