<p>The UO Channel at the University of Oregon is a gateway to video programs that reflect the quality, creativity, and diversity of academic and cultural life at the university. Featured programs include lectures, interviews, performances, symposia, documentary productions, and more. In addition to video/streaming media on demand, the UO Channel also provides access to campus radio stations.</p>
<p>Visitors will find such varied offerings as a recent (November 2005) conversation with film director David Lynch and a not-so-recent (circa 1934) recruitment video for the university. Invited speakers include authors, activists, and scholars, among others.</p>
<p>The UO Channel is a collaborative service of the UO Libraries, Public and Media Relations, and the Computing Center.</p>
