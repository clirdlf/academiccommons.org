<p>Harvard@Home offers dozens of rich multimedia programs, each of which allows in-depth exploration of a particular intellectual or artistic arena. Programs areÂ freely viewable by the public and are designed to be of general interest to those with curiosity about a variety of fields. Based on faculty and expert lectures and symposia, the programs feature highly edited streamed video segments, supplemented by additional program materials, including textual description, glossaries, timelines, maps, and QTVR.</p>
<p>All programs are open to the world. Topics run the gamut of disciplinary and interdisciplinary interests; each program offers from 45 minutes to many hours of video content. Harvard@Home publishes approximately one new program per month. Visitors may join the program announcement list to hear about new releases: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210531/mailto:athome@fas.harvard.edu">athome@fas.harvard.edu</a>.</p>
