<p>Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity 2004</p>
<p>Revised second edition (online)</p>
<p>Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity was published in 1989 in the Society of the Promotion of Roman Studies Monographs series, by Charlotte RouechÃ© with contributions by Joyce Reynolds. The second edition, expanded and revised, was published online in 2004 as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charlotte Roueché <em>Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity: The Late Roman and Byzantine Inscriptions</em>, revised second edition, 2004, (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100716212027/http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/ala2004">http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/ala2004</a>), ISBN  1897747179 (abbreviated to 'ala2004')</p></blockquote>
<p>The editions and commentary are by Charlotte Roueché except for text 1, by Joyce Reynolds. The electronic editorial conventions were developed by Tom Elliott (and the EpiDoc Collaborative), and the website and the supporting materials are the work of Gabriel Bodard, Paul Spence, and colleagues in the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London.<br />
<em><br />
</em>The publication consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full catalogue of the inscriptions, illustrated far more richly than would be possible in a conventional volume, and indexed by significant terms, lexical words, locations, dates, and bibliographical concordance;</li>
<li>Commentary and historical narrative, epigraphic introductions and prosopographical appendices, fully cross-referenced and hyper-linked across the site;</li>
<li>Reference materials including bibliography, links, clickable plans of the site, and repoductions of epigraphic notebooks;</li>
<li>A free text search engine, in case what you are looking for is not in the very full indices.</li>
</ul>
