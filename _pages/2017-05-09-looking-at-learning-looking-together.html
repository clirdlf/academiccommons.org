<p>What does it mean for colleagues in very different disciplines, in a community college, to work together on a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) project? What happens when they join together to take seriously their students' learning, their learning as individual professors, and their collaborative learning? And what happens when they undertake an electronic publication of that worka <a title="3LT" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184614/http://crossroads.georgetown.edu/vkp/dportfolio">digital gallery</a>?</p>
<p>With the support of the <a title="VKP" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184614/http://crossroads.georgetown.edu/vkp">Visible Knowledge Project</a> and the <a title="CNDLS" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184614/http://cndls.georgetown.edu/">Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship at Georgetown University</a>, two faculty from the <a title="BMCC" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184614/http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/">Borough of Manhattan Community College</a> (CUNY) have developed a website which documents student learning, as well as collaborative scholarship of teaching and learning--using the web as a medium to publish the process as well as the conclusions of their research into student-created digital storytelling projects.</p>
