<p>The Digital Classicist is a web-based hub for scholars and students interested in the application of Humanities Computing to undertake research into the ancient world. The main purpose of the site is to offer guidelines and suggestions of major technical issues. The site also features newsÂ about events, publications (print and electronic), and other developments in the field.</p>
<p>The main website contains an annotated list of classical projects that utilize computing technology, and links to freely available tools and resources of use to scholars engaging in such projects. The core of the project is the Wiki FAQ: an interactive platform for the building of a Frequently Asked Questions list, with answers and other suggestions offered by members of the community, and collectively authored work-in-progress guidelines and reports.</p>
<p>The site's creators seek to encourage the growth of a community of practice, which is open to everyone interested in the topic, regardless of skill or experience in technical matters, and language of contribution. As a general principle, key sections of the website or summaries of discussions will, where possible, be translated into the major languages of European scholarship: e.g. English, French, German, and Italian.</p>
<p>The Digital Classicist is hosted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100716212041/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre for Computing in the Humanities</a> at King's College London.</p>
