<p>Our friends at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.educause.edu">Educause</a> continue to try to provide some content about teaching and learning with technology. The latest ELI (Educause Learning Initiative) resources are a mixed bag. A two-page pdf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.educause.edu/content.asp?page_id=666&amp;ID=ELI7004&amp;bhcp=1">"7 Things You Should Know About Wikis"</a> might work as a quick cheat-sheet for the harrassed academic executive wanting to appear knowledgable when talking with techies about the Latest Thing. But it's not going to help many faculty members looking for real-world ideas about teaching with wikis. A sample nugget: "The possibilities for using wikis as the platform for collaborative projects are limited only by one's imagination and time."</p>
<p>On the other hand, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.educause.edu/LibraryDetailPage/666?ID=ELI3001">"Overview of E-portfolios"</a> by George Lorenzo and John Ittelson is a thorough and well-illustrated report about student, faculty, and institutional electronic portfolios. This "white paper" addresses a full range of issues and could well provide a foundation for institutional discussions about implementing some form of e-portfolio; looking at student e-portfolios, for instance, the authors ask good basic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>should an e-portfolio be an official record of a student's work?</li>
<li>how long should an e-portfolio remain at an institution after the student graduates?</li>
<li>who owns the e-portfolio?</li>
<li>how are e-portfoilios evaluated in a manner that is both valid and reliable?</li>
<li>how can an institution encourage critical reflection in the design and use of e-portfolios?</li>
</ul>
<p>These, of course, are just good questions. Whether or not Educause, the authors, or Academic Commons can prompt some good discussion about such questions is the real question.</p>
<p>The paper also includes links to some exemplary sites, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/KML/KEEP/index.htm">Carnegie Foundation's KEEP Toolkit</a> for building portfolios, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/cis/web_portfolios.htm">St. Olaf College's Center for Integrative Study</a> portfolios, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://portfolio.pdx.edu/">Portland State's</a> instutional site built with the open-source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>. The white paper briefly considers "tool sets" for e-portfolios and mentions the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://www.osportfolio.org/">Open Source Portfolio Initiative</a> (OSPI). For faculty and administrators looking for more information about exemplary portfolios, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620193333/http://kml.carnegiefoundation.org/OSP/">KEEP/OSP Case Studies Gallery</a> is definitely worth checking out.</p>
