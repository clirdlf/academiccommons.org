<p>The San Francisco Museum of Modern's Art <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620194631/http://www.sfmoma.org">(http://www.sfmoma.org/</a> ) retrospective on the work of Robert Bechtle explores Bechtle's life and work through videos of the artist working in his studio, as well as photographs, letters, newspaper clippings, and other primary source materials from his personal archive. A gallery of artworks zoom-enabled for closer inspection shows highlights from the artist's 40-year career. Accompanying the show is a nifty web application that provides access to a wide range of multimedia materials. This application serves as a preview of some of the new features that will be available in the 2.0 version of Pachyderm Project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620194631/http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm/index.shtml">(http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm/index.shtml</a>) which is a project being managed by the NMC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620194631/http://www.nmc.org">(</a><a title="http://www.nmc.org" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620194631/http://www.nmc.org">http://www.nmc.org</a>) which brings together software development teams and digital library experts from six NMC universities together with counterparts from five major museums to create a new, open source authoring environment for creators of web-based and multimedia learning experiences. Pachyderm should be of particular interest to small schools that do not have professional multimedia development shops.</p>
