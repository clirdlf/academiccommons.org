<p>NITLE encourages members of the liberal education community to use the Academic Commons to lead seminars that will increase the community’s collective capacity to engage in strategic, effective collaborations focused on integrating pedagogy, inquiry, and technology. We specifically encourage seminars that focus on specific practices, outcomes, and lessons learned that are extensible beyond their immediate context and relevant to a variety of institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>Academic Commons seminars enable real-time inter-institutional exchange and help participants build their personal learning networks. Using videoconferencing technologies, seminar leaders connect with colleagues from a variety of fields. Participants share knowledge, discuss questions and problems, learn from each other’s work, and generate fresh insights about how to collaborate strategically and successfully around the mission-driven integration of pedagogy and technology. Leading a seminar can be an effective way to expand the impact your collaborative initiative or program. Seminars are a good channel for engaging a broader network of colleagues, finding potential collaborative partners, or simply sharing your hard-earned knowledge with others and gathering useful feedback.</p>
