<p>This site is intended to help students, collectors and researchers to better understand the Ukiyo-e technique. Taking Wesleyan University's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620203937/http://www.wesleyan.edu/dac/">Davison Art Center Collection</a> of 18th and 19th century Japanese prints as its starting point, the site focuses on techniques utilized in prints from the collection. Photographs and video clips show demonstrations of the techniques by master printmaker Keiji Shinohara. These demonstrations are accompanied by traditional prints from the DAC collection, and contemporary prints by Keiji Shinohara.With its impressive depth of information, captivating visuals and easy navigation, the Ukiyo-E Techniques website highlights the level of collaboration that is required to produce these sorts of materials.</p>
